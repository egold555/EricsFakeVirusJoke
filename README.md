# EricsFakeVirusJoke
This is a fake annoying "virus" that will annoy the living crap out of you. 
This needs to be run as adminastrator because it disables talk manager and explorer.exe so you cant close the program. 
I wrote this just out of cerosity. 
***THIS PROGRAM WRITES TO THE REGISTRY TO DISABLE TASK MANAGER TEMPERARORY***

***TO CLOSE: push f12 (the password is "trollface"). ***

This program is not attended to be used by anyone. 
I just wanted to share my code with the world on creating programs and getting more people started with coding.
I am not responcible for anything that happends if you deside to run this proram what so ever :)
